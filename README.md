# Hi, I'm Katlyn E McGraw 👋

I am a PhD level research scientist specializing in epidemiology with expertise in R programming and statistical analysis, scientific writing and publications, and grant writing. I focus on how different exposures contribute to cardiovascular disease at the population health level. I typically assess the impact of exposures from tobacco and e-cigarette exposure, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), metals, benzene, and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using exposure biomarkers, self-reported contributors from questionnaires, or ambient air monitoring. To estimate the impact on cardiovascular disease, I typically assess clinically relevant cardiovascular disease outcomes such as traditional risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol), subclinical risk factors (coronary artery calcification), and hospitalizations and mortality (ICD10 codes for circulatory diseases).
