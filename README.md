# Hi, I'm Katlyn E McGraw 👋

I am a PhD level epidemiologist with expertise in R programming and statistical analysis, scientific writing, project management, and grant writing. I focus on how different exposures contribute to cardiovascular disease at the population health level. I typically assess the impact of exposures using biomarkers, self-reported contributors from questionnaires, or ambient air monitoring. To estimate the impact on cardiovascular disease, I assess clinically relevant outcomes such as traditional risk factors, subclinical risk factors, and hospitalizations and mortality.
